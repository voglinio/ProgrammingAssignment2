## R Programming Cource 
## Prorgamming Assignement 2
## Costas Voglis
##
## In this assignement we are asked to create a wrapper structure
## around a matrix object that will store its inverse and persist
## it until we change the matrix. We will follow the implementation
## of the example code makeVector

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
